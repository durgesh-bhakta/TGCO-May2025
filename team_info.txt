Approach Summary:
We simulate a robot navigating a 2D grid bounded between -9999 and +9999. The robot moves only to "safe" squares, where the digit sum of the product of coordinates is less than 19.
 
Algorithm:
- Used BFS for both:
  - Exploring all reachable safe squares from (0,0)
  - Finding the shortest safe path between two points
 
Safety Logic:
- isSafe(x, y) checks bounds and digit sum of the product
- Grid boundaries are strictly enforced
 
Optimizations:
- HashSet ensures each cell is visited once
- Coordinates stored as "x,y" strings for fast lookup
 
Extras:
- Realistic grid simulation with boundary checks
- Fully modular and unit-tested using JUnit
